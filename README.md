- then upload the files to your server via file manager or sftp
- then go to startup section of the server and name it `server.py` (if u made python server and downloaded the server.py file) or `server.js` (if u made js server and downloaded the server.js file)  `server.jar` (if u made java server and downloaded the server.jar file)
